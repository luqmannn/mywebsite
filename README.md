# Mywebsite

This is my personal static website created from Hugo using [charlola template](https://github.com/charlola/hugo-theme-charlolamode). It is minimal and lightweight template just
enough for my needs.

## Things to do later
- [ ] Move all the tab from right to centre.
- [/] Remove bottom word built with â™¥ from charlola and LinkedIn share buttons from all pages.
- [ ] Fix Home link does not return back to Home in Articles, Projects, Tutorial.
- [ ] Remove the template (surprise and math braintrainer) from Articles and Projects.
- [ ] Change the order of Articles, Project, Tutorial to Tutorial, Project, Articles.
- [ ] Change fonts in certain part.
