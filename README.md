# Mywebsite

This is my personal static website created from Hugo using [charlola template](https://github.com/charlola/hugo-theme-charlolamode). It is minimal and lightweight template just
enough for my needs.

## Things to do later
- [x] Remove bottom word built with â™¥ from charlola and LinkedIn share buttons from all pages.
- [x] Fix Home link does not return back to Home and disable breadcrumbs.
- [x] Change the order of Articles, Project, Tutorial to Tutorial, Blog, Projects.
