So you want to become an IT pro and need a bunch of software, some of which are paid. No worries, I've got you covered! We'll take the el cheapo route, which is affordable and doesn't require too much effort. Warning: this is a very unprofessional guide, and no one endorses this kind of shady practice except me! The original article came from [here](https://chaah.awankloud.my/poor-man-guide-to-offensive-studies/), so I thought why not create my own version of it.

## Software (proprietary)
### Windows
Ah, the good old BS from Microsoft, where they charge you a premium price for the operating system but still put ads and heavy telemetry inside. Fear not, it's all part of the plan. You can use it with a watermark or remove it with a very cheap price.

### VMWare Workstation
We all know VMware Workstation is a very expensive piece of software for virtualization, but it is by far the better option and superior compared to VirtualBox. If you use any Linux distribution for your main PC, skip VMware and use KVM Virt-Manager instead!

### Office (Microsoft 365)
Need to create a fancy-looking report or slide presentation? Here comes the savior price that can save your dying wallet without using cheap premium accounts only to get blocked or wiped out by Microsoft in the next few months because they decide to revamp their entire office suite offering. I consider this an unbeatable price for personal use. You get Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, OneDrive, and Skype for one year.

### VPN
Sometimes we need to test some service or site from a different location around the world. A VPN allows you to basically change the geo-location of your IP address so that the service or site thinks that you're using it from another country. It provides some security, but it by no means makes you anonymous or private. There are so many VPN providers that claim that they keep no logs and protect your data, but when the gag order comes from the government or three-letter agency, they provide all user data and information without question at all.

This is why I despise most sponsored YouTube videos by VPN companies and the shills that keep preaching this BS nonsense that a VPN will anonymize and protect your data. For me, I use Mullvad because the sign-up process doesn't require any email or username nonsense that forces you to submit your personal data. Why other companies fail to learn and implement this? IDK. They also provide a generous pricing offer and accept payment in cryptocurrency (monero and bc) and even cash.

### Linux VPS
Currently, I'm using Linode's $5 (RM22.30) per month basic plan that shares the same physical CPU cores with other users for the sake of the right cost for most workloads.

## Software (free and open source)
### Bitwarden
Since a person holds multiple online accounts, we need to make sure that all of them use strong password combinations. Memorizing all passwords is a tedious and boring task. This is why I can guarantee that most users use the same password across their online accounts because remembering strong password combinations is a very hard task. So we use a password manager to generate and store all of the password combinations. This vault password will be locked and unlocked by using a single unique password that only we can remember, and there are also options to unlock it with a fingerprint.

### Joplin
Free and open-source note-taking applications that provide cloud synchronization across all devices at an affordable price. This is one of my go-to applications to jot down notes or if something immediate comes up, like an idea to write a certain thing.

### Ventoy
Create a bootable USB device that can store multiple image files (ISO) into a single pendrive without formatting the disk over and over. Format the drive once in BIOS/UEFI mode, and you're good to go. Copy and paste as many ISO files as you want, whether it is Windows 10, 11, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, HirenBootCD, and even some of the BSD variants like FreeBSD.

### Qbittorrent
It is self-explanatory. With the high and deep sea comes the great risk of giant waves. Be careful and use it with your own discretion. Use it only on your own machine in your home network.

## Hardware
### Pendrive
